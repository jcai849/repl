USAGE=$(cat << EOF
  repl [-h] process [pipe]

  Spawn an interactive slave process and a named pipe, with slave
  stdin reading from both the named pipe (created by this script)
  as well as master stdin. This named pipe can then be written to
  by any other editor or program, as a means of indirect access
  to the interactive slave process (e.g. a REPL)

  Options:
    -h : Display this help message and exit.
    process : Interactive process to spawn.
    pipe : Name for the communication pipe to be created
           (defaults to "\${process}repl").
